# stocks-analysis
For VBA exercise

## Overview of Project

In this project, we were working on a Green energy stocks' data-set using VBA (Visual Basics for Application)
which is a programing language used to interact with Excel spreadsheets. We used VBA to create MACROs to read and
write into cells and worksheets, use complex logics to make calculations and to automate report building in order to
perform analysis in Excel.

### Purpose

The main purpose of the project was to study and compare various Green stocks with respect to their performance.
The analysis can be useful in selecting high performing Green energy stocks, which can be included in the portfolio
for investment.

## Analysis

### Stock performance comparison

Stock trade Volume represents the number of shares of a stock that have changed hands over a certain period of time. Stocks
with higher volumes indicate that more investors are buying or selling them. There is a relation between the stock trade volume
and the price of the stock. Therefore, an analysis of price and stock trade volume can be helpful for an investor to establish a
better understanding of the trends in stock price and any changes to it thereafter.

If a stock trading volume rises over a period of time, it means more people are buying the shares which is pushing the stock price higher. One the other hand, if the price of a stock is falling whereas the stock trading volume is rising over a period of time, it means more people are selling their shares.

However, if the stock price is increasing and the stock trading volume is decreasing over a period of time or vice-versa, it suggests a lack of interest amongst people towards the stock. This means that stock price trajectory is uncertain in future. In such a scenario, it might not be a good idea to buy that particular stock.

Considering the above explanation following conclusions can be made from the given data: \

1. ENPH and RUN seem to be high performing stocks since their total trading volume and return have increased in both 2017 and 2018. This means more people are buying these stocks which has pushed their prices up and generated higher returns.

2. DQ, HASI, SEDG, TERP and VSLR seem to be the stocks whose trading volume has increased between 2017-2018 but their returns have gone down. This means more people are selling these stocks which has pushed their prices down and generated lower returns. However SEDG stock returns have slightly decreased from 2017. So it might necessitate a deeper analysis.

3. AY, CSIQ, FSLR, JKS and SPWR stocks' returns and trading volume have decreased from 2017 to 2018. It seems people are holding on to their shares in hand and are hoping to sell them when the stock prices increase. The buyers are holding off and expecting the prices to hit a low point. This explains a lower trading volume. The prices have gone lower due to lower trading volume. But again, other factors may need to be explored for more accurate analysis.
